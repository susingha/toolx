<h1>INTRO</h1>
Knowledge is not having all answers, its being open to all questions. Curious TUX, a general quiz is here to test the proliferation of knowledge in its original form. Quizzers note that they need not be a Linux Guru to crack this one.
<br><br>
Consisting of two rounds of elimination and a Finale, it is going to witness a unique blend of knowledge and perception for those who care to know. Moreover we expect Mr. Barry O' Brian, one of the greatest quizzing minds to bestow Curious TUX with his presence
