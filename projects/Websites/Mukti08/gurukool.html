<h1>INTRO</h1>
When they talk, we listen.
<br><br>
Yes, there shall be a time when the masters who have sculpted the budding brains shall Speak, and share their thoughts with the rest. Time for us to be captivated! 
<br><br>
No matter how much we know or achieve our learning will always be a novice under the aura of their knowledge and expertise.
<br><br>
We have been honoured to have the gracious presence of Personalities and Dignitaries alike in our previous editions of MUKTI. As always we bring the best in business, literally, to MUKTI ’08.
