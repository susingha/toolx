Return values to the shell are:
-1	an error occured
0	port is open
1	port is closed
2	connection establishment timed out

-=[ Notes

1. Non-blocking connetcs are one of the most non-portable areas
   of network programming. Hope for the best.
2. I hope AIX support works out fine. The only AIX box I have access
   to returns "AIX aixterm3 3 4 0006404B4C00" (whatever this means)
   on a 'uname -a'.
