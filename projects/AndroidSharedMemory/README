Project Status: Not fully stable

This Project is intended to create a shared memory in android using ashmem.
we are trying to populate a shared memory from one app and read it from another app
In android the shared memory implementation is different from linux kernel in the sense that
the shared memory cannot be created using a global filename. But one app is responsible
for creating a shared memory using the ashmem api available in the android framework, get a
file descriptor for its region and transfer the file descriptor to the other app using 
parcel file descriptor. The other app needs to retrieve this file desciptor in order to 
access the shared memory.
Ofcourse the file descriptor in the other app would be different than the one in the
shared memory creator app.

The whole excercise to be fully functionable needs a change in the android framework
to register the service { AID_MEDIA, "vendor.enea.Buffer" },
in frameworks/base/cmds/servicemanager/service_manager.c

This is native code and hence is not platform independent.
An improved version of the implementation has been decided upon which shall deal with
java code to parcel the file descriptor onto the other app and would be relatively
platform independent.
