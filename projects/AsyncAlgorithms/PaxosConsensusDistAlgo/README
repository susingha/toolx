This project includes two contributions as follows:

1. Byzantine Paxos implementation in DistAlgo
   Leslie Lamport, Microsoft Research June 2011, June 2012
	FILES:
	vrpaxos-distalgo-bolin_con.da   - implements the basic consensus Paxos algorithm
	vrpaxos-distalgo-bolin_byz.da   - implements the Byzantined Paxos algorithm (f acceptors failure)
	vrpaxos-distalgo-bolin_pcon.da  - implements the pcon Paxos algorithm
	vrpaxos-distalgo-bolin_bpcon.da - implements the Byzantined Paxos pcon algorithm
2. Optimized version of MultiPaxos in DistAlgo
   Robbert van Renesse, Department of Computer Science, Cornell University
	FILES:
	vrpaxos-distalgo-bolin.da       - The basic multi paxos algorithm by Bo Lin
	vrpaxos-distalgo-optim-opt.da   - implements the Optimized version of the basic multi paxos algorithm
	optimizationNotes.txt           - The optimzation technique adopted and steps taken


RUN:
All algorithms are implemented in DistAlgo (a python module to handle message passing in distributed systems)
Follow instructions in DistAlgo package for running the algorithms
recommended version: python3

OUTPUTS:
The implementations run the algorithms in a simulated environment where each processor is simulated by 
a different process and the communication among the processors are simulated by message passing among
processes. The outputs prints a message whenever a request gets sent and prints a received message when
a consensus is achieved on a message after receiving them from all contributors (acceptors)
When a consensus is not achieved and when a error condition is met, an assert message is printed.
